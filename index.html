        <h2>The story</h2>
        <article class="browser">
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
            <p>They said, <i> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</i> The farmer said,<i> “Maybe." </i></p>
            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <i> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” </i> The farmer again said, <i> “Maybe.” </i> </p>
        </article>
        <article class="browser">
            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            </p>
            <p>
                The neighbors then said, <i> “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” </i> and the farmer responded, <i> “Maybe.” </i> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i>“Isn’t that great!” </i> Again, he said, <i> “Maybe.”</i>

                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
